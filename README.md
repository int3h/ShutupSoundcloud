Shut Up SoundCloud
================

This is a browser userscript that will cause the comments left by others on [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) pages to be hidden by default. You can unhide them by clicking the small 'speech bubble' icon in the bottom-right corner of each SoundCloud song.

This script only works on pages on the SoundCloud.com domain; it does not work on other pages with embeded SoundCloud songs. It only effects hiding of comments during playback; it does not actually remove any comments, stop your ability to leave comments, or anything similar.

To install this script in your browser:
* **Firefox**: Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and then load the [userscript](https://github.com/int3h/ShutupSoundcloud/raw/master/shutup-soundcloud.user.js)
* **Chrome**: Download the [CRX file](https://github.com/int3h/ShutupSoundcloud/blob/master/ShutupSoundcloud.crx) (right-click, 'Save Link as'). In Chrome, open your [Extensions page](chrome://extensions/) and then drag-and-drop the CRX file from your hard drive onto the Extensions page in the Chrome browser. If you are getting permissions problems (e.g., Chrome is saying you can not load scripts from this page,) you are not correctly saving the file to disk first, then dragging-and-dropping the CRX.
* **Other browsers that supprt Userscripts (Safari, Opera, etc.)**: Browse to the [userscript](https://github.com/int3h/ShutupSoundcloud/raw/master/shutup-soundcloud.user.js) and install the script when prompted.
